fluent-ai is a lightweight, type-safe AI toolkit that seamlessly integrates multiple AI providers. It features structured outputs, streaming capabilities, and job serialization support.

## Installation

```sh
npm install fluent-ai
```

## AI Service provider support

fluent-ai includes support for multiple AI providers and modalities.

| Provider  | chat               | embedding          | image              | listModels         |
| --------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| anthropic | :white_check_mark: |                    |                    | :white_check_mark:	|
| fal       |                    |                    | :white_check_mark: |					|
| ollama    | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |					   | :white_check_mark:	|
| openai    | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:	|
| voyageai  |                    | :white_check_mark: |                    |					|

By default, API keys for providers are read from environment variable (`process.env`) following the format `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

You can also initialize a provider with manual API key settings:

```ts
import { openai } from "fluent-ai";

openai({ apiKey: "<key>" });
```

## Job API

Each request to AI providers is wrapped in a `Job`. which can also serialized and deserialized. A [fluent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) API with method chaining help create jobs easily.

### Method chaining

```ts
import { openai, userPrompt } from "fluent-ai";

const job = openai()
  .chat("gpt-4o-mini")
  .messages([userPrompt("Hi")])
  .temperature(0.5)
  .maxTokens(1024);
```

### Declaration

Alternatively, fluent-ai also supports job declaration from json object.

```ts
import { load } from "fluent-ai";

const job = load({
  provider: "openai",
  chat: {
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    params: {
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: "hi" }],
      temperature: 0.5,
    },
  },
});
```

### Job serialization and deserialization

To serialize a job to a JSON object, use the `dump` method:

```ts
const obj = await job.dump();
```

This allows you to save the job's state for later use, such as storing it in a queue or database.
To recreate and execute a job from the JSON object, use the `load` function:

```ts
import { load } from "fluent-ai";

const job = load(obj);
await job.run();
```

## Chat completions

Chat completion, such as ChatGPT, is the most common AI service. It generates responses in a conversational format based on given inputs, also knows as prompts.

### Text generation

```ts
import { openai, systemPrompt, userPrompt } from "fluent-ai";

const job = openai()
  .chat("gpt-4o-mini")
  .messages([systemPrompt("You are a helpful assistant"), userPrompt("Hi")]);

const { text } = await job.run();
```

### Structured output

Structured output from AI chat completions involves formatting the responses based on predefined json schema. This feature is essential when building applications with chat completions.

[Zod](https://zod.dev/) is a popular type of validation library for TypeScript and JavaScript that allows developers to define and validate data schemas in a concise and type-safe manner. fluent-ai provides built-in integration for declare json-schema with zod. To use zod integration, first install `zod` from npm. Any parameter in fluent-ai that accepts a JSON schema will also work with a Zod schema.

```sh
npm install zod
```

fluent-ai provides a consistent `jsonSchema()` function for all providers to generate structured output. For more details, refer to the [structured output docs](/docs/chat-structured-outputs.md)

```ts
import { z } from "zod";
import { openai, userPrompt } from "fluent-ai";

const personSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  age: z.number(),
});

const job = openai()
  .chat("gpt-4o-mini")
  .messages([userPrompt("generate a person with name and age in json format")])
  .jsonSchema(personSchema, "person");

const { object } = await job.run();
```

### Function calling (tool calling)

Function calling (or tool calling) is an advanced functionality in chat completions that enhances their ability to interact with external systems and perform specific tasks.

Here's how to create a tool:

```ts
import { z } from "zod";
import { tool } from "fluent-ai";

const weatherTool = tool("get_current_weather")
  .description("Get the current weather in a given location")
  .parameters(
    z.object({
      location: z.string(),
      unit: z.enum(["celsius", "fahrenheit"]).optional(),
    })
  );
```

To use the tool, add it to a chat job with a function-calling-enabled model, such as `gpt-4o-mini` from openai.

```ts
const job = openai().chat("gpt-4o-mini").tool(weatherTool);

const { toolCalls } = await job
  .messages([userPrompt("What is the weather in San Francisco?")])
  .run();
```

### Streaming support

Rather than waiting for the complete response, streaming enables the model to return portions of the response as they're generated. fluent-ai provides built-in streaming support for text, objects, and tools in chat models.

```ts
const job = openai()
  .chat("gpt-4o-mini")
  .messages([systemPrompt("You are a helpful assistant"), userPrompt("Hi")])
  .stream();

const { stream } = await job.run();
for await (const chunk of stream) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```

fluent-ai supports streaming text, object and tool calls on demand. For more details, see the [streaming docs](/docs/chat-streaming.md).

### Vision support

You can leverage chat models with vision capabilities by including an image URL in your prompt.

```ts
import { openai, systemPrompt, userPrompt } from "fluent-ai";

openai()
  .chat("gpt-4o-mini")
  .messages([
    userPrompt("Describe the image", { image: { url: "<image_url>" } }),
  ]);
```

## Embedding

```ts
import { openai } from "fluent-ai";

const job = openai().embedding("text-embedding-3-small").input("hello");
const result = await job.run();
```

## Image generation

```ts
import { openai } from "fluent-ai";

const job = openai().image("dalle-2").prompt("a cat").n(1).size("512x512");
const result = await job.run();
```
